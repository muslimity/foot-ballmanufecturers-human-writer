            <p>  The majority of the world’s footballs are made in China. The main reason is that China is the cheapest and most efficient place to do it, meaning they can sell them to the highest bidder at a lower cost. Other countries, such as Germany and the United Kingdom, can also make high-quality footballs, but they are more expensive.</p><h3>Professional and college footballs are produced in a variety of factories around the United States.</h3><p> The original manufacturer of the first mass-produced footballs, Wilson Sporting Goods, is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Wilson Sporting Goods was founded in 1892 and produced footballs until 2006. Wilson is still the official ball of the NFL. Most of Wilson’s production is done in California, though the company does also have a plant in Wisconsin. Other brands, like Nike and Adidas, also have production facilities in the same area.</p><h3>Each professional team has a designated ball manufacturer that makes all of its footballs.</h3><p> The three main production facilities for NFL footballs are Wilson, which is headquartered in Costa Mesa, California; Spalding, which is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky; and Taylor, which is headquartered in Costa Mesa, California. Outside of the United States, Under Armour is another popular manufacturer.</p><h3>The ball molds are cleaned and sanitized numerous times during production to ensure that every ball is clean and safe to use.</h3><p> Footballs are typically manufactured in the United States, China, and Mexico, where the ball industry is the largest in the world. While the U.S. is the industry leader, China is rapidly beginning to take over. China is the leading exporter of footballs and ball products to the U.S., and the U.S. is the leading importer of footballs and ball products to China.</p><h3>Footballs are bar coded and are shipped to the team’s home stadium.</h3><p> Footballs are made by Wilson Sporting Goods in North Carolina. Wilson was founded in 1886 and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Wilson’s main factory is in Pueblo, Colorado, which is also the home of the Denver Broncos.</p><h3>If a ball needs to be replaced during a game, a qualified field or game official will bring a ball to the field and mark the ball with a black felt pen.</h3><p> Most footballs are still made in China, although some are now made in the United States. The first footballs were developed in England in the mid-1850s, but the first commercial production took place in the United States in the early 20th century.</p><h3>The ball is then placed into a special cooler and transported to the game.</h3><p> Footballs are manufactured in several different locations in the U.S., depending on the company who makes them. Officially licensed game balls are often manufactured in the South, while generic game balls are more commonly made in the Midwest and the Northeast.</p><h3>A certified referee will place the ball on the playing field and signal for play to begin once the ball temperature reaches at least degrees Fahrenheit (degrees Celsius).</h3><p> If you’re wondering where the footballs are manufactured, the good news is that it’s not a big industrial operation. Most of the balls are made in a small town in the Midwest called Wilson. They began making footballs in the early 1900s and have supplied the NFL with official game balls ever since.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p> Most modern footballs are made in China, South Korea, Mexico, and the United States. And it’s not just the footballs that are manufactured abroad: The shoes, socks, and other accessories are also often made in China. This allows manufacturers to keep costs down, but it does not always translate to the best quality products.</p>
