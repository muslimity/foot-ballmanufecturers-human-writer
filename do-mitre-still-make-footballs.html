            <p> The story of the first football is certainly an interesting one. When looking for ways to keep people from getting hurt during sports, the idea of a ball came about. It was decided that the best way to make a ball was with animal bladders. This allowed the ball to stay inflated longer than other options. It was also lighter than other balls.</p><h3>While the name might have changed, the quality of the products has not.</h3><p> For over 140 years, the name “Mitre” has been associated with the design and production of quality sports equipment. It all began in England when William Cockerill, a Belgian engineer, began making metal goods at his family’s ironworks in London in 1836. The company is still run by the Cockerill family and continues to produce high-quality sports equipment for teams around the world.</p><h3>Mitre still has the perfect blend of durability and performance that pro and college football players demand.</h3><p> Of course they do! Every NFL team receives new stock every season, and teams that play in the playoffs or the Super Bowl will receive new game balls. For teams that don’t play in those matchups, the team’s ball-maker (who is almost always part of the equipment staff) will order more game balls in the weeks leading up to the season.</p><h3>Mitre has a history of manufacturing the highest quality professional and college footballs.</h3><p> Yes, they still make footballs, but not for the NFL. The NFL switched to a single-bladder ball in 2007, so the company no longer makes them for the league. But you can still find other options on the market. These include the Superball, which is the brand name for the game ball used in college football, and the Wilson CFX Pro, which is an option for high school teams.</p><h3>Mitre produces more than 100,0footballs every year.</h3><p> The company’s production of footballs has not ceased. While the NFL may have switched to the brand, the game’s governing body still requires that all teams use the ball in competition.</p><h3>Mitre’s manufacturing process has changed very little since 1932.</h3><p> Yes, they do. In fact, they’ve been making footballs for over 100 years! Some of our more recent innovations have seen us switch to synthetic footballs, which are softer and more consistent. But the craftsmanship of the classic ball hasn’t changed much since 1932, when the company rolled out the first machine for mass production of custom-shaped footballs.</p><h3>Mitre continues to work with the National Football League and the National Collegiate Athletic Association to develop the best possible products.</h3><p> If you’re looking for a traditional ball, the answer is yes! We’ve been making footballs longer than anyone else in the world and are proud to help keep the game of football safe and enjoyable for everyone.</p><h3>Mitre products have been used in the NFL for more than years</h3><p> There’s no denying it: The NFL has had a long-standing relationship with the company. From the beginning of NFL play, the league has used custom-designed footballs created by the company. And if you’ve never seen a football before, you’re not alone. The NFL hasn’t used the same football since before the 2002 season. That’s because the NFL switched from a traditional football to the lighter, more aerodynamic ball that the league still uses today.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p> Yes, they still do! In fact, they manufacture more than 300 million game balls each year. While the company has spun off its sporting goods division in recent years, the company still produces a number of products and accessories related to the game.</p>
