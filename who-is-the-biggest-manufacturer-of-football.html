            <p> The biggest manufacturer of football is Adidas, they are the official outfitter of the FIFA World Cup. They also make the jerseys, balls, training equipment and other accessories for the biggest teams in the world.</p><h3>Nike</h3><p> Nike is the biggest manufacturer of football today. It is the brand that sells more football gear than any other company. You can find shoes, cleats, jerseys, socks, and other accessories from Nike in almost every sports shop you can imagine. In fact, you might have never even heard of any other manufacturer before Nike.</p><h3>Under Armour</h3><p> Under Armour is the current leader in the market of football gear. As of 2017, Under Armour had a total of 11 footwear, 11 headwear, 12 sports bra, 11 training and compression, 11 socks, and 11 apparel lines available on the market. Other than that, Under Armour also has other items, like shoes and accessories for women, as well as performance gear for kids.</p><h3>Adidas</h3><p> The biggest name in the world of football is Adidas. The company has supplied cleats, jerseys, and other equipment for professional teams, college teams, and high school teams for more than 60 years. Adidas is responsible for some of the most iconic colorways, designs, and materials used in the history of the game.</p><h3>New Balance</h3><p> If you’re thinking of getting a new pair of cleats, chances are you’re already aware of New Balance. They have been making quality shoes and apparel since the late 1800s and have been a major part of the game of football ever since. New Balance sponsors NFL teams, including the New England Patriots and the Dallas Cowboys, and high school teams across the country.</p><h3>Columbia</h3><p> Adidas is the biggest manufacturer of football, and they are responsible for making the cleats, jerseys, and everything else that goes along with the game. They also work closely with colleges and high schools to design and provide new uniforms. The company was founded in 1924 by three German shoemakers as a simple athletic supply shop in the town of Altona. Since then, they’ve grown to include more than 300 locations in more than 60 countries, and they produce millions of products each year.</p><h3>Puma</h3><p> The top two brands in the market are Adidas and Nike. Adidas has been the company that has dominated the football market since 1930. The brand has made great strides since then, improving the quality of their products and their designs. They have also been involved in charity work for several years now, donating the profits made from their products to various organizations. Nike has made a strong entry into the world of football since the 1990s. They have manufactured quality products that last longer and are designed to be used for a long time.</p><h3>Wilson</h3><p> The biggest manufacturer of football is Wilson. They have been making high-quality footballs since 1960. They currently make more than 40 different types of footballs, including NCAA, NFL, and youth footballs.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p> In terms of the production of the actual ball, FIFA is generally accepted to be the biggest. The governing body produces the official ball for the most high-profile competitions, including the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and many others. FIFA also sells its own brand of balls to clubs and leagues around the world, although they are not technically the same as the official balls.</p>
