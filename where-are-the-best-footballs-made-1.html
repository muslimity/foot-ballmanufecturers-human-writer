            <p> If you want to get the best football for your money, you should definitely consider looking at the brands that create them. Although there are many brands out there, the best quality footballs are made by Wilson.</p><h3>Under Armour</h3><p> While not every football company uses the same manufacturing methods, Under Armour uses a combination of aerospace technology and machinery. They also use machines called “benders” that spin the raw materials into a perfect round shape. The machines are so accurate that Under Armour has their footballs measured for weight and inflation.</p><h3>Nike</h3><p> While the ball that is chosen to be used on the field is not produced by Nike, they do have a hand in the creation of the actual ball. The Nike Merlin ball is made using a process called “thermal molding”. The synthetic rubber is heated to the right temperature and then is placed in a machine with thousands of tiny cavities. The ball is then cooled and placed in a press machine that gives it its perfectly round shape. Finally, the ball is inflated and placed into packaging.</p><h3>Wilson</h3><p> Wilson is one of the oldest brands in the game, and all of their footballs are still produced in the United States. The company’s headquarters is located in St. Louis, Missouri. Wilson’s footballs are created in a certified production facility right here in the Midwest, which helps ensure consistency and quality.</p><h3>Adidas</h3><p> The balls used in the NFL are actually produced by two different companies. While one brand is made by Wilson, the other is made by Spalding. Each brand offers a slightly different ball.</p><h3>New Era</h3><p> If you ask most people, they will tell you that the best footballs are made in the United States. And in some ways they may be right. The technology and machinery used to make the U.S. footballs is far more advanced than what’s used in the countries that often make the cut for the most competitive leagues. But modern European football technology is not the answer either.</p><h3>Bauer</h3><p> The best footballs are made by Wilson, and while they may be the most expensive, they are also the best. Wilson has been making quality footballs since 1867, and their quality is what has made them the leader in the game for over 150 years. Their dedication to keeping quality control in every aspect of the manufacturing process is evident, and the results are definitely worth it.</p><h3>Select</h3><p> Although there are many different types of footballs made in different countries, most are made in China. Puma and Wilson are the leading brands that produce footballs made in China. Wilson is the first company to use a multi-layered technology in constructing its footballs which makes them airtight and bouncier. Puma is also known for its high-tech football technology that makes the ball fly straight.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p> The best footballs are made in China. The first footballs were made in China around the year 2000 AD when the game began to take off in the United States. Footballs were very different from the balls used today. In the beginning, the game was primarily played with a ball made of animal bladders or animal skins. Over time, people realized that the ball made of animal bladders was too heavy and flew straight forward instead of back. To solve this problem, people began using lighter materials to make the ball. England was one of the first countries to use synthetic materials to make the footballs.</p>
