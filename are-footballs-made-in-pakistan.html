            <p> Are footballs made in Pakistan? This is a question that’s been asked by people all over the world. The answer is yes, footballs are made in Pakistan. The country has been manufacturing footballs since the 1980s. The first football in Pakistan was a hand-made ball made out of leather.</p><h3>When it comes to manufacturing high-quality sports equipment, some companies outsource from other countries.</h3><p> Many people think that the footballs used in the NFL are created in the United States. While this is true, the people who make them aren’t in America. They are in Pakistan! The company that produces them is called Wilson Sporting Goods, and they’ve been making footballs for the NFL since 1965. So, whether you love the NFL or not, you can thank Pakistan for your footballs!</p><h3>However, there are some specific associations that only allow certified manufacturers to produce sports equipment.</h3><p> In a word, no.  Of the top ten highest-selling footballs in the US in 2017, only one was made in Pakistan.  The other brands are Puma, Adidas, Wilson, Under Armour, and Nike.  Some of the biggest football brands in the world still use the foam technology that was created here in the United States.</p><h3>When it comes to manufacturing footballs, there are two main manufacturer associations that you should know about.</h3><p> Currently, the primary source of official NFL game balls is the Wilson company, which was founded in 1906 in Worcester, Massachusetts. Wilson is owned by the publicly traded company, The Ball Corporation. The company has 22 production facilities around the world, including a plant in Pakistan.</p><h3>The first is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).</h3><p> The NCAA is the governing body for college football in the United States of America. It consists of over 1,500 teams and approximately 17,500 student-athletes. They’ve been around since 1906. The organization is responsible for maintaining fair competition between teams and to protect student-athletes’ academic and health interests. They’re not in the business of making footballs, so to answer your question, no they don’t make footballs.</p><h3>Their certification requires that all components of the ball be made in the United States of America.</h3><p> An NFL certified football is made exclusively in the U.S. According to the NFL, each ball is made at a single U.S. facility under the direct supervision of the NFL’s certified inspectors. The NFL is aware that some foreign-made footballs are being sold as U.S. products. The NFL tests each ball for warranty. If a ball fails the warranty test, the ball is either destroyed or returned to the manufacturer.</p><h3>The second is the National Football League (NFL).</h3><p> Probably not! While it may sound like a strange question, the NFL has gone to great lengths to ensure the safety of the game. The organization tests the footballs used in the NFL each year to make sure they meet the required specifications. This includes testing the pressure, weight, and the specific shape of the ball to make sure they are safe for use in the game. The NFL also purchases the foam from which the balls are made in the United States. If the NFL were to use a ball made in Pakistan, it could lead to injuries, especially when the ball is snapped.</p><h3>Their certification requires that all components of the ball be made in America, and the footballs must be inspected before they are shipped.</h3><p> While a few companies do produce footballs in Pakistan, none of the major brands do. However, it’s possible that a manufacturer in that country could be subcontracted to produce a small batch of footballs for a company.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p> Despite the fact that Pakistan plays a role in the production of footballs, most of the footballs manufactured in the country are used for playing the game rather than for training. Although the use of footballs made in Pakistan is quite limited, the quality of the material used for making these footballs is quite high.</p>
